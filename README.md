# C++ Game Engine

## Why C++?

First and foremost as a learning experience to teach me C++.
I have been liberal with my use of new features from C++11 onwards (variant, optional, span, string_view, move semantics, perhaps concepts even). This makes the language feel more familiar to me coming from Rust.

I am partially reimplementing a game engine I wrote in Java, but this C++ version should have much lower-level control.

Also the ease of interoperability with other libraries is fantastic. (however C++'s package management situation is not)
